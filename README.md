# CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model) 
CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) explains the connection between expected returns for assets, particularly stocks, and systemic risk or general investment hazards. This model provides a formula to calculate the expected return of an asset based on its risk level. The formula is as follows:

ERi=Rf+βi(ERm−Rf)
where:
ERi=expected return of investment
Rf=risk-free rate
βi=beta of the investment
(ERm−Rf)=market risk premium

In this equation, the expected return of an investment is calculated by adding the product of the beta of the investment and the market risk premium (difference between the expected return of the market and the risk-free rate) to the risk-free rate. The CAPM is a widely used tool in finance for determining expected returns and evaluating investment opportunities.
